Some guidance for troubleshooting:

On your octoprint server, you can run the python scripts that the plugin uses to get temps etc and make sure theyre working:

python3 EMCSCAN.py

This will scan the i2c bus to check for the existance of the various boards and output a list of what it finds on the various channels.
Channel 0 being direct connected, and channels 1 through 8 being the channels on the TCA9548A if you have it connected.

0 | 2101
1 | 9808
2 | Not found
etc

If youre not geting this output, you need to troubleshoot and make sure, for example, that you have all the python libraries
installed for the 2101 etc...

Once this is done, you should then be able to test the query script that goes and retrieves the temp and speeds from each channel:

python3 EMC2101.py 1 0

The first parameter is the channel you want to read, and the second parameter is 0 if you want to use the obboard sensor of the temperature
chip, or a 1 if you have a 2101 with an external temperature transistor.

You should see an output of the channel temp and speed. If you get a -1 | -1 then there is an error, usually in that you didnt pass the 2 parameters properly.
